jtHarass is a simple Bukkit Minecraft plugin that essentially acts as a "player behaviour management" plugin. When a player is set into harass mode slowness and mining fatigue potions are applied to them (+ block break restrictions [no block breaks!], item drop restrictions [no item drops!] and chat restrictions [no chat!]). When the player tries to break a block (it will take a long time) the break will be cancelled and the block will reappear. When a player tries to chat operators will be alerted and the message won't be sent. This is revokable by using the same command but potion effects won't automatically revoke. When the player is in the harass mode, if they try to respawn the potion effects will be automatically reapplied within ~1 second of respawn (depending on server lag).
